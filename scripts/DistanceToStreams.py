# Distance to Streams (Large and Small)
# Author: Timm Nawrocki, Alaska Center for Conservation Science
# Created on: 2018-06-26
# Usage: Must be executed as an ArcPy Script.
# Description: "Distance to Streams (Large and Small)" processes a Digital Elevation Model into a stream network attributed with stream order and then segregates streams of orders 3-9 (large streams) from streams of orders 1-2 (small streams). The euclidean distance to each type of stream is calculated and output as an integer distance raster. The stream network is also output as a feature class. The hydrographic area of influence must be larger than the study area to account for flow that enters the study area and influences stream order.
